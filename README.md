<p align="center">Autogenerated helper functions for generating a GraphQL AST</p>


This project generates helpers functions from the graphql/language AST flow descriptions. It is intended to help with building a valid GraphQL AST.

## Getting Started

`yarn add graphql-ast-types`

```js
import * as t from 'graphql-ast-types';
```

_The implementation here mimics that of `babel-types`. Thanks Babel team._
